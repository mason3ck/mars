        The fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, Mars is named after the Roman god of war. This planet has grown significantly in interest recently since the possibility of water existing, and with that, life. Originally the impoprtance of mars was minimal, being only a red dot in our night sky, however since the telescope, we have learned that the planet is much closer to our own than most others.
           __________________________________________________________

           With a reddish tint due to the iron oxide found within its rocky soil, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. Due to Mars being further from the sun at 136 Million miles compared to Earths distance of 92 million miles away, it is much colder and takes 668 days to revolve around the sun.

          Robotic scouts scour the rocky bodies that we have always looked to, and our hopes now are to live and prosper on these far-away lands. One such dreamer is Bas Lansdorp, a Dutch entrepreneur who started Mars One with the stated goal of landing on Mars by 2025, 5 years earlier than NASA’s expected date, 2030. The venture claims to have a business plan that could pay for everything the trip would need, reality TV. The voyage would be a huge spectacle, as Landsdorp tells, “We expect it’s worth up to 10 Olympic Games of media revenue, which is 45 billion U.S. dollars”. He’s not alone in this, 100,000 other volunteers have signed up to go to Mars and never return. Many other private companies are also wishing to go to Mars, notably SpaceX, who have pioneered rocket engineering in an attempt to make space travel affordable. _____________________
